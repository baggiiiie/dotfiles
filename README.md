### Karabiner-Elements

Need to enable full disk access for karabiner_grabber. See: [pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements#3051](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements/issues/3051)

Sometimes the below config is needed:
  for mac keyboard: (without corne) (and corne too) (all without karabiner)

```plaintext
    caps lock -> esc
    control -> caps lock
    options -> options
```

  with the above setup, mac keyboard and corne in karabiner (all device):

```plaintext
    left_option -> left_control
    left_control -> left_option
```
